        <p id="#Information technology">Information technology (IT) is the study or use of computers, telecommunication systems and other devices to
            create, process, store, retrieve and transmit information.[1] While the term is commonly used to refer to
            computers and computer networks, it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as
            television and telephones. Information technology is an application of computer science and computer
            engineering.

            An information technology system (IT system) is generally an information system, a communications system,
            or, more specifically speaking, a computer system — including all hardware, software, and peripheral
            equipment — operated by a limited group of IT users, and an IT project usually refers to the commissioning
            and implementation of an IT system.[2] IT systems play a vital role in facilitating efficient data
            management, enhancing communication networks, and supporting organizational processes across various
            industries. Successful IT projects require meticulous planning and ongoing maintenance to ensure optimal
            functionality and alignment with organizational objectives.

        <h2>Data processing</h2>
        <p id="#Data processing">Early electronic computers such as Colossus made use of punched tape, a long strip of paper on which data was
            represented by a series of holes, a technology now obsolete.Electronic data storage, which is used in
            modern computers, dates from World War II, when a form of delay-line memory was developed to remove the
            clutter from radar signals, the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line. The
            first random-access digital storage device was the Williams tube, which was based on a standard cathode ray
            tube. However, the information stored in it and delay-line memory was volatile in the fact that it had
            to be continuously refreshed, and thus was lost once power was removed. The earliest form of non-volatile
            computer storage was the magnetic drum, invented in 1932 and used in the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's
            first commercially available general-purpose electronic computer.


            IBM card storage warehouse located in Alexandria, Virginia in 1959. This is where the United States
            government kept storage of punched cards.
            IBM introduced the first hard disk drive in 1956, as a component of their 305 RAMAC computer system.
            Most digital data today is still stored magnetically on hard disks, or optically on media such as
            CD-ROMs. Until 2002 most information was stored on analog devices, but that year digital storage
            capacity exceeded analog for the first time. As of 2007, almost 94% of the data stored worldwide was held
            digitally: 52% on hard disks, 28% on optical devices, and 11% on digital magnetic tape. It has been
            estimated that the worldwide capacity to store information on electronic devices grew from less than 3
            exabytes in 1986 to 295 exabytes in 2007,doubling roughly every 3 years.</p>
