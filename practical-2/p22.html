        <p align="left">Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks
            typically associated
            with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It
            is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable
            machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their
            chances of achieving defined goals.</p>
        <p>High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation
            systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and
            Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art);
            and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are
            not perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being
            called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore."</p>
        <h1 align="center">About Computer</h1>
         <font face="arial" size="12" color="black"></font>
        <p align="center">A computer is a programmable electronic device that accepts data (input), processes it
            according to programmed instructions, and then produces results (output). It stores data and information for
            future use and can range from smartphones to high-end servers, combining hardware (physical components) and
            software (programs) to form a computer system. Modern computers are capable of a wide range of tasks, from
            complex calculations to browsing the internet and controlling other devices.
            Key Functions
            A computer performs four fundamental functions:
            Input: It takes in raw data through devices like keyboards or sensors.
            Processing: The Central Processing Unit (CPU) manipulates the data by following the instructions in software
            programs.
            Output: It presents the processed data or information in a human-readable format on devices like screens or
            printers.
            Storage: Data and programs are saved on storage devices for later use.

        <h1 align="right">Software</h1>
         <font face="arial" size="12" color="black"></font>
        <p align="right">Software is a collection of computer programs, data, and instructions that tell a computer or
            device how to perform specific tasks, making it the intangible, non-physical component of any digital
            system. It enables users to interact with devices, such as creating graphics, editing videos, and managing
            information, without needing to understand the underlying hardware. Software is categorized into three main
            types: System Software, which manages the computer's resources (e.g., operating systems); Application
            Software, which performs specific user tasks (e.g., word processors); and Programming Software, which helps
            developers create other software.</p>
